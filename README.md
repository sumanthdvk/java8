# java8
The code, currently, is limited to Asynchronous programming using Java 8.

## Learnings
* get vs. getNow (Main.java)
* Thread of execution (Main2.java)
* Changing the pool (Main3.java)
* Async vs. non-async (Main4.java)
    - In parallel streams, entire pipeline is condemned to run in a single thread.
    - It's not case with CompletableFuture.
* thenAccept (Main5.java)
* thenApply (Main5.java)
* Build a pipeline and execute it later on. (Main6.java)
